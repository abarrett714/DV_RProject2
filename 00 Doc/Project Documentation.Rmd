1)The first step of this project was to take the .csv file "hygdata_v3.csv" and reformat it using ETL code, which can be found in the 01 Data folder. This produced SQL code to create a table in Oracle and a reformatted csv file which was fit to be uploaded to oracle.

2) This chunk of R calls a program which queries the oracle database for the table "StarData10k".
```{r}
source("../01 Data/Database Creation Code.R", echo = TRUE)
```
