Color(legend) is also redefined as whether or not the passenger survived.\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot03.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\nFor the Fourth plot the variables are rearranged but the big difference is the addition of a facet command, which creates the 6 seperate plots.\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot04.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\nSimilar to the Second plot, the fifth plot requires that we once more redefine the dataframe, this time only using entries with an age under 10.\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot05.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n\n3) We designed the last plot ourselves and it shows the survival rates of people over the age of 50, compared to which class they were in.\n\nThe last plot is similar to the fifth plot, though instead of populating the dataframe with the very young passengers, it examines the elderly. The scale and label of the axis remains the same but the data itself changes.\n```{r}\nsource(\"../02 Visualizations/TitanicPlot06.R\", echo = TRUE)\n```\n",
